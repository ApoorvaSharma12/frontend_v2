# Attendance Approval System

## Project Description:

The Attendance Approval System is a web application designed to streamline attendance tracking and approval processes. Built with React, the frontend provides user-friendly interfaces for employee login, manual entry, and an admin dashboard. The system allows employees to log in, make manual attendance entries, and enables administrators to view and manage attendance data efficiently.
